-- Password Strength Analysis Report

Task 6 – Cyber Security Internship

Objective

The objective of this task is to understand password strength by testing different passwords using a password strength checking tool and analyzing how complexity affects resistance to password-cracking attacks.

---

##Tool Used

Online Password Strength Checker (visual strength meter)

Evaluation based on:

Password length

Character variety (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols)

Estimated time to crack

---

 *Passwords Tested & Results*

1) Password: sura1234

Strength Level:  Very Weak
Length: 8 characters
Composition:

Lowercase letters : used

Numbers : used

Uppercase letters : Not used

Symbols : Not used


Estimated Time to Crack: 5.6 seconds

  Analysis:

Uses a common name and numeric sequence (1234)

Easily vulnerable to dictionary attacks

Very fast to crack using brute-force attacks

    Conclusion: This password is insecure and should not be used.

---

2) Password: sura$972

Strength Level:  Medium
Length: 8 characters
Composition:

Lowercase letters : used

Numbers : used

Symbols : used

Uppercase letters : Not used


Estimated Time to Crack: 27 hours

  Analysis:

Inclusion of a symbol improves security

Still short in length

Lacks uppercase letters


  Conclusion: More secure than weak passwords but still vulnerable to advanced attacks.


---

3) Password: Sura@573*1

Strength Level:  Strong
Length: 10 characters
Composition:

Lowercase letters : used

Uppercase letters : used

Numbers : used

Symbols :used


Estimated Time to Crack: 4 months

  Analysis:

Uses mixed character types

Increased length significantly improves strength

Resistant to brute-force and dictionary attacks


  Conclusion: This password follows strong password best practices.

 Comparative Summary

Password	Strength	Crack Time	Security Level

sura1234	Very Weak	5.6 seconds	 Insecure
sura$972	Medium	        27 hours         Moderate
Sura@573*1	Strong	        4 months	 Secure

  Key Learnings

Password length is more important than complexity alone

Mixing uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols greatly increases security

Avoid names, patterns, and sequences

Strong passwords reduce the success of brute-force and dictionary attacks

    Common Password Attacks

1. Brute Force Attack

What it is:
The attacker tries all possible password combinations until the correct one is found.

How it works:

Starts with short passwords

Tries letters, numbers, and symbols in every combination


Why weak passwords fail:

Short passwords can be cracked very fast


Defense:

Use long passwords (12+ characters)

Enable account lockout and MFA

---

2.Dictionary Attack

What it is:
Uses a predefined list of common passwords instead of trying every combination.

Examples of common passwords:
password, admin123, qwerty, welcome

Why weak passwords fail:

Based on real words or names

Very fast attack


Defense:

Avoid common words and names

Use random or passphrase-based passwords

---

3.Hybrid Attack

What it is:
A combination of dictionary + brute force.

How it works:

Takes dictionary words

Adds numbers or symbols (password123, admin@1)


Why weak passwords fail:

Predictable patterns are easy to guess


Defense:

Avoid predictable substitutions

Use random character placement

---

     Best Practices for Strong Passwords

Use at least 10–16 characters

Combine uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols

Avoid personal information

Use unique passwords for each account

Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
