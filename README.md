#🔐 Passwords Tested

| Password       | Strength   | Estimated Time to Crack |
|---------------|-----------|--------------------------|
| sura1234      | Very Weak | 5.6 seconds              |
| sura$972      | Medium    | 27 hours                 |
| Sura@573*1    | Strong    | 4 months                 |

🔎 Analysis
- Short passwords with predictable patterns are vulnerable to dictionary and brute-force attacks.
- Adding symbols and numbers improves password strength.
- Increasing password length and using mixed character sets (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols) significantly increases resistance to attacks.
- Strong passwords take much longer to crack, making attacks impractical.

---

🧠 Common Password Attacks Studied
- **Brute Force Attack**
- **Dictionary Attack**
- **Hybrid Attack**

These attacks exploit weak, reused, or predictable passwords.

---

 🛡 Best Practices for Strong Passwords
- Use at least 10–16 characters
- Combine uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
- Avoid names, sequences, and personal information
- Use unique passwords for each account
- Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

---

🧪 Practical Testing

- Password strength was verified using an online strength checker.
- Results demonstrated that strong passwords significantly reduce the success rate of attacks.

---

📌 Outcome
This task helped in understanding how password complexity improves security and protects systems against common password attacks. Strong password practices are essential for secure authentication.
